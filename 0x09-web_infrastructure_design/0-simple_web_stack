Simple web infrastructure

What does it entail?
At a minimum, it consists of a server, a web server, 
an application server, a codebase, and a database

To be able to understand what each component is and 
its role in the setup, let’s take a scenario where a 
user wants to access www.foobar.com over the internet.


What is a server?
A server is a computer system or software application 
that provides services or resources to clients over a network. 
It is a physical or virtual machine hosting the web infrastructure.
Each server has an address(IP address) that is used to access it


What is the role of the domain name?
The domain name, foobar.com, serves as a human-readable alias for 
the server’s IP address, e.g. 8.8.8.8. This makes it easier for users
to access the website as it is easier to remember as compared to the actual address.


What type of DNS record is www in www.foobar.com?
Almost all domain names are prefixed with www. The www record is a 
subdomain that typically points to the main domain name. It’s usually 
configured as a CNAME(Canonical Name) record in the DNS.


What is the role of the web server?
The web server e.g. Nginx, Apache, handles incoming HTTP requests from 
clients and serves static files or routes dynamic requests to the 
application server for processing.


What is the role of the application server?
The application server executes the web application codebase, generates 
dynamic content, and interacts with the database to retrieve or update 
information as needed.


What is the role of the database?
The database e.g. MySQL, Postgresql, stores and manages structured data
used by the web application. This allows for efficient storage, retrieval, 
and manipulation of data required for the website’s functionality.


What is the server using to communicate with the user’s computer requesting the website?
The server communicates with the user’s computer over the HTTP protocol, 
exchanging requests and responses containing web content.


As simple as it may seem, there are limitations to this infrastructure:

-> Single Point of Failure — Since we only have one server, it represents 
a single point of failure. If the server goes down due to hardware failure 
or system troubles, the entire website becomes inaccessible.

-> Downtime during maintenance — During maintenance tasks such as deploying 
new code or updating server configurations, the web server may need to be 
restarted, resulting in temporary downtime for the website.

-> Scalability limitations — With only one server, the infrastructure cannot 
easily handle a significant increase in incoming traffic.
