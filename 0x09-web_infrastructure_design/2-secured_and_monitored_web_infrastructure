 Secured and monitored web infrastructure

The infrastructure setup is augmented with firewalls, SSL certification, and 
monitoring clients.


Why the extra resources?
-> Firewalls — This is to control and secure network traffic, protecting the 
servers from unauthorized access and potential security threats.

-> SSL Certificate — This is to encrypt traffic between clients and servers, 
ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.

-> Monitoring clients — This is to collect performance metrics and monitor the 
health and availability of the servers and services, enabling proactive 
management and troubleshooting.

What are firewalls for?
Firewalls control and secure network traffic, protecting the servers from 
unauthorized access and potential security threats.


Why is the traffic served over HTTPS?
HTTPS encrypts data transmitted between clients and servers, protecting 
sensitive information such as login credentials, personal details, and financial 
transactions from eavesdropping and tampering.


What monitoring is used for?
Monitoring is used to track the performance, availability, and health of the web 
infrastructure and detect any anomalies that may arise.


How is the monitoring tool collecting data?
It collects data by deploying monitoring agents or clients on each server to 
gather metrics, logs, and other relevant information. The data is then 
aggregated to the monitoring dashboard.


What should you do if you want to monitor your web server QPS?
If you want to monitor the web server’s query per second (QPS), you can 
configure the monitoring tool to collect metrics related to incoming HTTP 
requests and response times.


Again, this setup has some issues:

-> SSL termination at the load balancer — This can expose decrypted traffic 
within the internal network, potentially compromising data security. It is 
recommended to terminate SSL at the web server level for end-to-end encryption.

-> Only one MySQL server for write operations — This creates a single point of 
failure which can result in data loss or service disruption. Clustering may 
mitigate this risk.

-> Having servers with all the same components — This may lead to a lack of 
diversity in the infrastructure, making it vulnerable to common mode failures.
It’s advisable to distribute components across different servers or employ 
different servers or employ redundancy to enhance reliability and fault 
tolerance.
